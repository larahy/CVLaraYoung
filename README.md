Curriculum Vitae
===============

LARA YOUNG 

I'm a junior web developer based in London. After graduating from Bristol I spent several years in the publishing industry at literary agents in London and New York. Concluding that I'd like to implement my own ideas, I decided to develop my technical skills, and have not looked back since.

  Highly selective 12 week full-time course. 
  Ruby, object oriented programming and software design

  Final project: DOG EARED - a Rails 4 app using the Amazon API to allow users to tweet their three most 
  'dog eared'   books -- the ones you keep coming back to, and live on in your mind even several years after
  reading.  Each user    would select their three books, and then a custom url would be generated with their
  selection that would be         hardcoded into the tweet, the page also included and other analytics on all 
  users choices and a constantly updating window showing the trending tweets with the chosen hashtag (#dogeared).

EXPERIENCE
2012-2013 - Grace Belgravia, London – Arts and Culture Curator.
I was responsible for designing and populating the website, thus, my interest in web-development was born! 
Other roles included sourcing and managing stock for the library, implementing and promoting a diverse event
calendar from debates co-hosted with 5x15, to wine tastings from Berry Bros. I enjoyed the diversity of my
responsibilities and working in a team on both long-term strategies, and last minute problem solving, to overcome
those inevitable ‘teething problems’ hand in hand with the birth of a full working business.

2010-2012 -	United Agents LLP, London 
For two and a half years I worked for two agents representing a diverse client list of creative writers, 
established journalists, and academics. My roles include drafting contracts, reading unsolicited manuscripts,
writing reviews, planning speaking engagements, as well as the day-to-day admin of looking after over 50 clients.
Keeping track of the contracts, publication schedules, publicity events and tours of so many people taught me to
approach my work in a highly organised and structured way.  Interpersonal skills were essential in dealing with such
a number and variety of clients, and in developing relationships with editors at publishing houses, and literary
agencies abroad.

2007, 2008, 2009 - The London Original Print Fair 
2 weeks acting as a translator and helping set up prior to the fair, which is the longest running specialist print
fair in the world. A great education in all periods of printmaking including the early woodcuts of Dürer, and a
wonderful opportunity to work with the fair’s director Helen Rosslyn, previously a member of the Print department at
Christies. 

2006 - Samara Private Game Reserve, South Africa 
The six months spent at this new game reserve were enormously challenging, but also extremely fulfilling.  Given 
the small size of the game reserve at the time I had an active role in every aspect of hospitality.  The customary
18 hour working day, and the variety of my responsibilities taught me the true meaning of hard work and forced me 
to direct and delegate effectively.
