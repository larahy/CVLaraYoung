## Previous Experience 

 * 2012-2013: Grace Belgravia, London – Arts and Culture Curator.
I was responsible for designing and populating the website, thus, my interest in web-development was born! 
Other roles included sourcing and managing stock for the library, implementing and promoting a diverse event
calendar from debates co-hosted with 5x15, to wine tastings from Berry Bros.

 * 2010-2012:	United Agents LLP, London 
For two and a half years I worked for two agents representing a diverse client list of creative writers,established journalists, and academics. My roles include drafting contracts, reading unsolicited manuscripts, writing reviews, planning speaking engagements, as well as the day-to-day admin of looking after over 50 clients. Keeping track of the contracts, publication schedules, publicity events and tours of so many people taught me to approach my work in a highly organised and structured way.  Interpersonal skills were essential in dealing with such a number and variety of clients, and in developing relationships with editors at publishing houses, and literary agencies abroad.

 * 2007, 2008, 2009: The London Original Print Fair 
2 weeks acting as a translator and helping set up prior to the fair, which is the longest running specialist print fair in the world. A great education in all periods of printmaking including the early woodcuts of Dürer, and a wonderful opportunity to work with the fair’s director Helen Rosslyn, previously a member of the Print department at Christies.
